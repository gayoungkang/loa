               <p class="precaution_title">A. Basic Principles</p>
               a. LOA FOUNDATION PTE. LTD. ("LOA") seeks to comply with the applicable laws and regulations relating to personal data, including but not limited to the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (Act No. 26 of 2012) of Singapore (collectively, the "Data Protection Legislation").
               <br/>
               b. This data privacy policy ("Data Privacy Policy") sets out the basis for collection, use, disclosure and processing of personal data by LOA. This policy will apply to the use of the website features, products and services provided by LOA (collectively, "Services") on [https://loaprotocol.io] ("Website"), excluding Services which may be subject to separate privacy policies which do not incorporate this Data Privacy Policy.
               <br/>
               c. In this Data Privacy Policy, (i) "personal data" means data, whether true or not, about an individual who can be identified from that data, or from that data and other information to which the organization has or is likely to have access, and (ii) "User" means you, the person using the Website or the Services, and if you are using the Website or the Services on behalf of an entity, references to "User" means you, that entity or both, as appropriate.
               <br/>
               d. Please read this Data Privacy Policy carefully. If there are any queries or feedback concerning this Data Privacy Policy, please contact LOA's Data Protection Officer at the email address set out at Article 20 below.
               <br/>
               <br/>
               <h5>2. Collection OF PERSONAL DATA</h5>

               <p class="precaution_title">A. Collection of Personal Data</p>
               a. Personal data which LOA may collect include, without limitation, a User's name, address, nationality, email address, phone number, gender, birth date, ID card, online identifier (such as username), device unique identity, operating system or version, hardware information, cookie, browser information, date and time spent on the Services, history log and financial information (such as credit card numbers, bank account information and digital or crypto wallet address).
               <br/>
               b. LOA does not collect sensitive personal data (race, thoughts and beliefs, political beliefs, criminal records or medical records) which collection may constitute a violation of the fundamental human rights of the User.
               <br/>
               c. LOA collects personal data in a number of different ways. For example:

               <br/>

               a. In relation to any User, LOA may collect personal data either: <br/>

               I. when such User (or its authorized representative) voluntarily provides such personal data to LOA, for example, when completing the KYC process or when subscribing for the use of, or in the course of using, the Services; or<br/>
               II. automatically, during such User's interaction with the Website and use of the Services.
               <br/>
               b. Where a User voluntarily provides any personal data or information, such User represents and warrants that:
               <br/>
               I. such personal data or information is accurate and complete; and<br/>
               II. if such personal data or information relates to a third party, such User has obtained the consent of the said third party to the collection, use, disclosure and processing of such third party's personal data or information on the terms set forth in this Data Privacy Policy, and is duly authorized by the third party to provide such third party's personal data or information.

               b. A User is deemed to have consented to the collection, use, disclosure and processing of the personal data in accordance with this Data Privacy Policy: 
               <br/>
               I. when such User (or its duly authorized representative) voluntarily provides the personal data; <br/>
               II. when such User (or its duly authorized representative) is aware of the purpose for which the personal data is provided; <br/>
               III. it is reasonable for such User (or its duly authorized representative) to have provided the personal data to LOA in the circumstances; or<br/>
               iv. any other circumstances where the Data Protection Legislation provides for the deemed consent of such User. <br/>

               <br/>

               III. where such collection, use, disclosure and processing are otherwise required by law or upon lawful request by governmental authorities. <br/>
               <br/>

               <p class="precaution_title">RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES</p>
               <br>
               Prospective purchasers of LOA tokens (as referred to in this whitepaper) should carefully consider and evaluate all risks and uncertainties associated with LOA PROCOTOL, the distributor and their respective businesses and operations, the LOA tokens, the LOA PROCOTOL Initial Token Sale (each as referred to in the whitepaper), all information set out in this whitepaper and the T&Cs prior to any purchase of LOA tokens. If any of such risks and uncertainties develop into actual events, the business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects of LOA PROCOTOL could be materially and adversely affected. In such cases, you may lose all or part of the value of the LOA tokens.
                No US Citizens are eligible to take part in this ICO unless they have permission from their regulatory bodies.
               <br>
               <p class="precaution_title">LOA STOCK DISCLAIMER</p>
               <br>
               The assigned LOA Stock tokens to the contributors will be added automatically to their account balances set in their profiles. These tokens are rewards to appreciate the contributors to the LOA platform project. For the LOA Stock tokens, some legal permissions are needed, the tokens will be visible on the users' accounts as their balances, but it’s not possible to withdraw or release these tokens until the legal permissions are granted to the project. After we get the permissions for the LOA Stock tokens the users will be notified through an announcement in social media of LOA Platform project, that is when the users will be able to withdraw their tokens. In case the project couldn’t get the legal permissions for any reason, instead of every LOA Stock token, four Rental Processor tokens will be assigned to the contributors. For this reason, it’s obvious that the LOA Platform project has no obligation for definitive release and delivering LOA Stock tokens, and the contributors approve this possible condition when they studied disclaimer sections, therefore deprived themselves of their right to claim the LOA Stock tokens.

                            LOA의 통합 금융 시스템 구축의 첫 주자로써, P2P 투자 플랫폼이 오픈합니다. P2P 플랫폼 은 기존의 P2P 대출의 높은 장벽을 낮출 수 있도록, 암호화폐를 연계하여 신용 조회와 서류 제출의 과정을 생략합니다. P2P 시스템은 부동산을 담보로 투자 및 대출을 제공합니다. 고객은 손쉽게 대출, 상환, 투자, 투자금 회수 등의 업무를 진행할 수 있습니다. 또한, 고객은 실시간으로 자신의 금융 투자 포트폴리오를 조회, 수정할 수 있습니다.
