               <p class="precaution_title">A. Basic Principles</p>
               a. LOA FOUNDATION PTE. LTD. ("LOA") seeks to comply with the applicable laws and regulations relating to personal data, including but not limited to the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (Act No. 26 of 2012) of Singapore (collectively, the "Data Protection Legislation").
               <br/>
               b. This data privacy policy ("Data Privacy Policy") sets out the basis for collection, use, disclosure and processing of personal data by LOA. This policy will apply to the use of the website features, products and services provided by LOA (collectively, "Services") on [https://loaprotocol.io] ("Website"), excluding Services which may be subject to separate privacy policies which do not incorporate this Data Privacy Policy.
               <br/>
               c. In this Data Privacy Policy, (i) "personal data" means data, whether true or not, about an individual who can be identified from that data, or from that data and other information to which the organization has or is likely to have access, and (ii) "User" means you, the person using the Website or the Services, and if you are using the Website or the Services on behalf of an entity, references to "User" means you, that entity or both, as appropriate.
               <br/>
               d. Please read this Data Privacy Policy carefully. If there are any queries or feedback concerning this Data Privacy Policy, please contact LOA's Data Protection Officer at the email address set out at Article 20 below.
               <br/>
               <br/>
               <h5>2. Collection OF PERSONAL DATA</h5>

               <p class="precaution_title">A. Collection of Personal Data</p>
               a. Personal data which LOA may collect include, without limitation, a User's name, address, nationality, email address, phone number, gender, birth date, ID card, online identifier (such as username), device unique identity, operating system or version, hardware information, cookie, browser information, date and time spent on the Services, history log and financial information (such as credit card numbers, bank account information and digital or crypto wallet address).
               <br/>
               b. LOA does not collect sensitive personal data (race, thoughts and beliefs, political beliefs, criminal records or medical records) which collection may constitute a violation of the fundamental human rights of the User.
               <br/>
               c. LOA collects personal data in a number of different ways. For example:

               a. In relation to any User, LOA may collect personal data either: <br/>

               I. when such User (or its authorized representative) voluntarily provides such personal data to LOA, for example, when completing the KYC process or when subscribing for the use of, or in the course of using, the Services; or<br/>
               II. automatically, during such User's interaction with the Website and use of the Services.
               <br/>
               b. Where a User voluntarily provides any personal data or information, such User represents and warrants that:
               <br/>
               I. such personal data or information is accurate and complete; and<br/>
               II. if such personal data or information relates to a third party, such User has obtained the consent of the said third party to the collection, use, disclosure and processing of such third party's personal data or information on the terms set forth in this Data Privacy Policy, and is duly authorized by the third party to provide such third party's personal data or information.

               b. A User is deemed to have consented to the collection, use, disclosure and processing of the personal data in accordance with this Data Privacy Policy: 
               <br/>
               I. when such User (or its duly authorized representative) voluntarily provides the personal data; <br/>
               II. when such User (or its duly authorized representative) is aware of the purpose for which the personal data is provided; <br/>
               III. it is reasonable for such User (or its duly authorized representative) to have provided the personal data to LOA in the circumstances; or<br/>
               iv. any other circumstances where the Data Protection Legislation provides for the deemed consent of such User. <br/>

               IX. complying with any applicable laws, regulations, codes of practice, guidelines or rules or to assist in law enforcement and investigations conducted by any governmental or regulatory authority; <br/>
               X. any other purposes for which the relevant User has provided the personal data; <br/>
               XI. transmitting to any third parties (including, for example, third party service providers and agents and relevant governmental and regulatory authorities, whether in Singapore or elsewhere) for the aforementioned purposes; and<br/>
               XII. any other purposes which are necessary, ancillary or consequential to the above. <br/>
               b.

               <br/>
               c.

               II. the personal data has been processed to be personally unidentifiable, and will be used for statistical analysis; or <br/>
               III. where such collection, use, disclosure and processing are otherwise required by law or upon lawful request by governmental authorities. <br/>
               <br/>

               c. LOA may transfer personal data outside Singapore to countries which may have data protection rules that are different from those of Singapore. However, LOA shall take measures to ensure that any such transfers comply with the Data Protection Legislation, and such personal data remains protected to the standards described in this Data Privacy Policy. In certain circumstances, courts, law enforcement agencies, regulatory agencies or security authorities in those other countries may be entitled to access the personal data. <br/>
               <br/>

               <p class="precaution_title">C. Outsourced Handling of Personal Data</p>

Upon receipt of the request to withdraw the User's consent, LOA will require a reasonable time to process the request and for LOA to notify the User of the consequences of such withdrawal, including any legal consequences which may affect the User's rights and liabilities.

            <p class="precaution_title">RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES</p>
            <br>
            Prospective purchasers of LOA tokens (as referred to in this whitepaper) should carefully consider and evaluate all risks and uncertainties associated with LOA PROCOTOL, the distributor and their respective businesses and operations, the LOA tokens, the LOA PROCOTOL Initial Token Sale (each as referred to in the whitepaper), all information set out in this whitepaper and the T&Cs prior to any purchase of LOA tokens. If any of such risks and uncertainties develop into actual events, the business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects of LOA PROCOTOL could be materially and adversely affected. In such cases, you may lose all or part of the value of the LOA tokens.
             No US Citizens are eligible to take part in this ICO unless they have permission from their regulatory bodies.
            <br>
            <p class="precaution_title">LOA STOCK DISCLAIMER</p>
            <br>
            The assigned LOA Stock tokens to the contributors will be added automatically to their account balances set in their profiles. These tokens are rewards to appreciate the contributors to the LOA platform project. For the LOA Stock tokens, some legal permissions are needed, the tokens will be visible on the users' accounts as their balances, but it’s not possible to withdraw or release these tokens until the legal permissions are granted to the project. After we get the permissions for the LOA Stock tokens the users will be notified through an announcement in social media of LOA Platform project, that is when the users will be able to withdraw their tokens. In case the project couldn’t get the legal permissions for any reason, instead of every LOA Stock token, four Rental Processor tokens will be assigned to the contributors. For this reason, it’s obvious that the LOA Platform project has no obligation for definitive release and delivering LOA Stock tokens, and the contributors approve this possible condition when they studied disclaimer sections, therefore deprived themselves of their right to claim the LOA Stock tokens.

In order to alleviate the high barriers to entry with the existing P2P loans, the procedures for credit inquiries and submission of documents are eliminated with the linkage established with the cryptocurrencies. The P2P system renders the services for investment and loans with the security of the real properties. The customers can easily take care of the related tasks such as the loans, repayment, investment, recovery of investment fund and others. Moreover, the customers can query and adjust their own financial investment portfolios on a real-time basis.

It presents the innovational business model of the cryptocurrencies by allowing the execution of investment and loan transactions on the basis of the cryptocurrencies, by guaranteeing the amount of interest at the time of withdrawal of the cryptocurrencies from the staking wallet, which is the key product in C2C platform, on the basis of the value at the time of investment placement and by allowing the expectation of additional profits from the appreciation of the deposit assets.

This can ensure the stability of asset protection through decentralization on the basis of the DEX transactions between individuals. In addition, since LSDT makes it possible to purchase LOA with the currencies of the different countries in the world, the access to LOA platform can be made far easier.
