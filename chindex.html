               <p class="precaution_title">A. Basic Principles</p>
               a. LOA FOUNDATION PTE. LTD. ("LOA") seeks to comply with the applicable laws and regulations relating to personal data, including but not limited to the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (Act No. 26 of 2012) of Singapore (collectively, the "Data Protection Legislation").
               <br/>
               b. This data privacy policy ("Data Privacy Policy") sets out the basis for collection, use, disclosure and processing of personal data by LOA. This policy will apply to the use of the website features, products and services provided by LOA (collectively, "Services") on [https://loaprotocol.io] ("Website"), excluding Services which may be subject to separate privacy policies which do not incorporate this Data Privacy Policy.
               <br/>
               c. In this Data Privacy Policy, (i) "personal data" means data, whether true or not, about an individual who can be identified from that data, or from that data and other information to which the organization has or is likely to have access, and (ii) "User" means you, the person using the Website or the Services, and if you are using the Website or the Services on behalf of an entity, references to "User" means you, that entity or both, as appropriate.
               <br/>
               d. Please read this Data Privacy Policy carefully. If there are any queries or feedback concerning this Data Privacy Policy, please contact LOA's Data Protection Officer at the email address set out at Article 20 below.
               <br/>
               <br/>
               <h5>2. Collection OF PERSONAL DATA</h5>

               <p class="precaution_title">A. Collection of Personal Data</p>
               a. Personal data which LOA may collect include, without limitation, a User's name, address, nationality, email address, phone number, gender, birth date, ID card, online identifier (such as username), device unique identity, operating system or version, hardware information, cookie, browser information, date and time spent on the Services, history log and financial information (such as credit card numbers, bank account information and digital or crypto wallet address).
               <br/>
               b. LOA does not collect sensitive personal data (race, thoughts and beliefs, political beliefs, criminal records or medical records) which collection may constitute a violation of the fundamental human rights of the User.
               <br/>
               c. LOA collects personal data in a number of different ways. For example:

               II. as part of the know-your-customer ("KYC") process by LOA, LOA may collect a User's name, nationality, contact details, country of residence, date of birth, sex, photo, identity documents (such as national identification card, driver's license, passport, etc.) and wallet address. Where required by the applicable law, LOA will redact or delete personally identifiable numbers such as the national identification number, the driver’s license number and the passport number; <br/>

               a. In relation to any User, LOA may collect personal data either: <br/>

               I. when such User (or its authorized representative) voluntarily provides such personal data to LOA, for example, when completing the KYC process or when subscribing for the use of, or in the course of using, the Services; or<br/>
               II. automatically, during such User's interaction with the Website and use of the Services.
               <br/>
               b. Where a User voluntarily provides any personal data or information, such User represents and warrants that:
               <br/>
               I. such personal data or information is accurate and complete; and<br/>
               II. if such personal data or information relates to a third party, such User has obtained the consent of the said third party to the collection, use, disclosure and processing of such third party's personal data or information on the terms set forth in this Data Privacy Policy, and is duly authorized by the third party to provide such third party's personal data or information.
               <br/>

               <br/>
               b. A User is deemed to have consented to the collection, use, disclosure and processing of the personal data in accordance with this Data Privacy Policy: 
               <br/>
               I. when such User (or its duly authorized representative) voluntarily provides the personal data; <br/>
               II. when such User (or its duly authorized representative) is aware of the purpose for which the personal data is provided; <br/>
               III. it is reasonable for such User (or its duly authorized representative) to have provided the personal data to LOA in the circumstances; or<br/>
               iv. any other circumstances where the Data Protection Legislation provides for the deemed consent of such User. <br/>
               <br/>

               VIII. conducting investigations or internal audits, or taking action, including in relation to any violation of the laws or terms and conditions applicable to the use of the Website or any of the Services; <br/>
               IX. complying with any applicable laws, regulations, codes of practice, guidelines or rules or to assist in law enforcement and investigations conducted by any governmental or regulatory authority; <br/>
               X. any other purposes for which the relevant User has provided the personal data; <br/>
               XI. transmitting to any third parties (including, for example, third party service providers and agents and relevant governmental and regulatory authorities, whether in Singapore or elsewhere) for the aforementioned purposes; and<br/>
               XII. any other purposes which are necessary, ancillary or consequential to the above. <br/>
               b. LOA may continue to collect, use, disclose or otherwise process personal data for any of the purposes listed above, even in situations where the User's relationship with LOA (for example, pursuant to a contract) has been terminated or altered in any way, for a reasonable period thereafter (including, where applicable, a period to enable LOA to enforce its rights against the User).
               <br/>
               c. LOA will collect, use, disclose and otherwise process the User's personal data only for the purposes set out in Article 5(a) and only to the extent allowed under the Data Protection Legislation.

               II. the personal data has been processed to be personally unidentifiable, and will be used for statistical analysis; or <br/>
               III. where such collection, use, disclosure and processing are otherwise required by law or upon lawful request by governmental authorities. <br/>
               <br/>

               c. LOA may transfer personal data outside Singapore to countries which may have data protection rules that are different from those of Singapore. However, LOA shall take measures to ensure that any such transfers comply with the Data Protection Legislation, and such personal data remains protected to the standards described in this Data Privacy Policy. In certain circumstances, courts, law enforcement agencies, regulatory agencies or security authorities in those other countries may be entitled to access the personal data. <br/>
               <br/>

               <p class="precaution_title">C. Outsourced Handling of Personal Data</p>
               LOA may outsource the handling of Users' personal data to third party service providers for the purposes of performing KYC checks, anti-money laundering checks, countering terrorism financing checks and/or any other checks as required by the applicable laws on the Users.

            <p class="precaution_title">RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES</p>
            <br>
            Prospective purchasers of LOA tokens (as referred to in this whitepaper) should carefully consider and evaluate all risks and uncertainties associated with LOA PROCOTOL, the distributor and their respective businesses and operations, the LOA tokens, the LOA PROCOTOL Initial Token Sale (each as referred to in the whitepaper), all information set out in this whitepaper and the T&Cs prior to any purchase of LOA tokens. If any of such risks and uncertainties develop into actual events, the business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects of LOA PROCOTOL could be materially and adversely affected. In such cases, you may lose all or part of the value of the LOA tokens.
             No US Citizens are eligible to take part in this ICO unless they have permission from their regulatory bodies.
            <br>
            <p class="precaution_title">LOA STOCK DISCLAIMER</p>
            <br>
            The assigned LOA Stock tokens to the contributors will be added automatically to their account balances set in their profiles. These tokens are rewards to appreciate the contributors to the LOA platform project. For the LOA Stock tokens, some legal permissions are needed, the tokens will be visible on the users' accounts as their balances, but it’s not possible to withdraw or release these tokens until the legal permissions are granted to the project. After we get the permissions for the LOA Stock tokens the users will be notified through an announcement in social media of LOA Platform project, that is when the users will be able to withdraw their tokens. In case the project couldn’t get the legal permissions for any reason, instead of every LOA Stock token, four Rental Processor tokens will be assigned to the contributors. For this reason, it’s obvious that the LOA Platform project has no obligation for definitive release and delivering LOA Stock tokens, and the contributors approve this possible condition when they studied disclaimer sections, therefore deprived themselves of their right to claim the LOA Stock tokens.
